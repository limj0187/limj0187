today,

HR courses, ask Yanru about the ones that I cannot do now
read papers sent by Guangyuan

ask prof
cncl lab desk
ask questions about the talk
ask about the cncl laptop, bag and headset
what is this abut 10 seminars per acedemic year?
what is my topic for this survey paper? "survey of generative AI applications on anomaly detection in manufacturing"
what is scope for survey paper?
do i need to come up with a list of 100 papers?
probably need to watch this video again. 

GAN Generative Adversarial Networks
GDM Generative Diffusion model
NF Normalising Flow 
Transformers
VAE Variational AutoEncoders

survey structure
1 intro
  problems faced by topic of survey
  how each type of gai is used to tackle each of these problems
2 related work
  background knowledge of gai and related surveys 
    different gais, gan, vae, nf, t, etc,
    how they work + how advantages and disadvantages
    maybe some recent advancements in this ai
    add a figure of how each ai is structured?
  related surveys
    gai and what is different about these surveys
    ai enabled physical layer comunications (ai applications in anomaly detections)
    what does each survey 
  table for summarising all related surveys for both gai and anomaly detection
  remember to highlight why this survey is different from the other related ones
3 in depth analysis of existing work
  how gai is used to engage different parts of anomaly detection
  and which survey/paper is relevant to which part 
4 future research directions 
  summarise and future research paths
5 conclusion
