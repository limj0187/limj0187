today:
some survey things everyday
do the survey paper things
  definition of anomaly detection
  how is this survey different from others?

later:
research integrity course

thoughts:
ask dusit and bryan what can he contribute to my phd
  dusit wants me to.cc him when Kevin and Thomas said OK to Bryan being a Co- supervisor 
  what do I want to do with this PhD?


ask prof:
  cncl lab desk
  ask about the cncl laptop, bag and headset

applying generative ai to anomaly detection has many potential benefits for manufacturing. generative ai can help with simulating different operating conditions, which can lead to a broader dataseet in which anomaly detection systems can learn from, this can also include rare or even completely unknown scenarios. This means that manufacturers can identify potential problems even before they occur, leading to improved efficiency and reducing costs for the manufactuing process.
