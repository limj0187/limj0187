Dear Prof Dusit,

I would like to clarify a few things from the meeting yestrerday,

Is the focus for this survey paper going to be:
"survey of generative AI applications on anomaly detection in manufacturing"?

Can I include keywords such as:
sensors, factory, GAN, VAE, IOT, anomaly detection, time series data, manufacturing
Or is there any other keywords that I should include?

If you have the time, I would be grateful if I could ask you some additional questions later.

Thank you for your help.

Thank you,
Lim Jiun Yeu
